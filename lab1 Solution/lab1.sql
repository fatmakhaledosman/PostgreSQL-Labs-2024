-- 1. Install PostgreSQL DBMS.
-- The scenario is that as an instructor in ITI, you have grade-keeping responsibilities.
-- You want to convert the grading process from a manual operation using a gradebook to an
-- electronic representation using database.
-- In this case:
-- - For each student, you keep track his name, contact info (email, address), and multiple
--   phone numbers.
-- - Each Student belong to Track (Telecom, OpenSource, Java, Game,..), and each track
--   have different students
-- - Each track have different subjects/courses such as (C, CPP, HTML, â€¦), and each student
--   study subjects/courses based on the track that he belong to it
-- - For each subject, you need to define the name and the description and max score (total
--   grade 100).
-- - The students achieve score in subject by exam result.
-- - For each exam which taken by student you must store Exam date, student score in
--   exam (such as 75).
-- - Keep track of Students and Track which he belong to it, and subjects owned by Tack ,
--   and Subjects which will studied by each student.

-- 2. Design ERD and write down the mapping schema.

    - PRIMARY KEY (Exam_ID, Student_ID)



-- 3. Create your mapped tables with their columns in PostgreSQL.


-- 4. Insert at minimum 5 Rows at each table
